//greater than --> $gt
//greater than and equal to -->$gte
//finding all the age greater than and equal to 20
db.collectionName.find({age:{$gte:20}})

//less than --> $lt
//less than and equal to --> $lte
//finding all the less than and equal to documents in a collection
db.collectionNmae.find({age:{$lte:30}})

//equal to --> $eq
//not equal to --> $ne
//getting all equal and not equal documtes from a collection
db.collectionName.find({age:{$eq:20}})
db.collectioName.find({age:{$ne:"bala"}})

//finding documents that are matching matching to a array
db.collectionName.find({age:{$in:[20,21,30]}})


//Logical operators

//it is used to join two query conditions
//$and --> if both conditions are needed
//$or --> either of the conditions are needed
//$not --> to avoid or negates that document
//$nor --> to avoid or negates all the conditions of a query
